# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict house prices using various features from a dataset. The dataset used is from Kaggle and includes information such as lot area, overall quality, year built, and sale price. The project utilizes a linear regression model to make predictions and visualize the results.

## Features
- **Scatter Plot**: Relationship between Lot Area and Sale Price
- **Histogram**: Distribution of Sale Prices
- **Box Plot**: Sale Price by Overall Quality
- **Violin Plot**: Sale Price by Year Built
- **Pair Plot**: Selected Features
- **Bar Plot**: Average Sale Price by Neighborhood
- **Line Plot**: Sale Price Trend Over Years
- **Swarm Plot**: Sale Price by House Style
- **KDE Plot**: Sale Price Distribution by Central Air
- **Count Plot**: Count of Houses by Overall Quality
- **Joint Plot**: Sale Price vs. GrLivArea
- **Scatter Plot**: Actual Prices vs Predicted Prices

## Data
The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data). Make sure to download it and place it in the project directory.

## Installation Conclusion 
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Conclusion
The linear regression model provides a reasonable prediction of house prices, though there is room for improvement. Visualizations help in understanding the data and the model's performance.
